# Future Improvements for WindowManager & UI

## 1. Error and Warning Dialogs
Add these methods to `WindowManager` for more user-friendly feedback:

```python
def show_error(self, message: str, title: str = "Error"):
    msg_box = QMessageBox()
    msg_box.setIcon(QMessageBox.Critical)
    msg_box.setWindowTitle(title)
    msg_box.setText(message)
    msg_box.exec_()

def show_warning(self, message: str, title: str = "Warning"):
    msg_box = QMessageBox()
    msg_box.setIcon(QMessageBox.Warning)
    msg_box.setWindowTitle(title)
    msg_box.setText(message)
    msg_box.exec_()
```

---

## 2. Centralized Window Closing/Switching
If more windows are added (e.g., Target window), consider a method to close all open windows or switch between them:

```python
def close_all_windows(self):
    for win in [self.login_window, self.register_window, self.controller_window]:
        if win:
            win.close()
```

---

## 3. User Feedback for Other Actions
For new features (file transfer, remote control, etc.), use `show_message`, `show_error`, or `show_warning` to inform the user of success/failure.

---

## 4. Loading/Progress Dialogs
For long operations, add a method to show a progress dialog or spinner:

```python
def show_progress(self, message: str = "Please wait..."):
    progress = QProgressDialog(message, None, 0, 0)
    progress.setWindowModality(Qt.ApplicationModal)
    progress.setCancelButton(None)
    progress.show()
    return progress  # Remember to .close() it when done
```

---

## 5. Logging User Actions
Expand logging to include more user actions (button clicks, errors, etc.) for better analytics and debugging.

**Keep this checklist handy and implement as your project grows!**
